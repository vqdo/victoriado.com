BRAND
========

- Casual/Unpretentious
Throughout the webpage I maintain a conversational tone. I want it to seem like
I am speaking with the viewer, rather than simply displaying my work. The main
text on the landing page is "hello!". 

- Open
The actual design is not too complex. I rely a lot on bright blocks of color and
accents. There is ample white space so the viewer does not feel claustrophobic. 
I try to be welcoming to emails. 

- Skilled
I tried to showcase projects requiring slightly different skill sets (web design,
web app development, and mobile app development) to demonstrate the breadth of
my knowledge. I also link to my GitHub account and my professional profile.

I am mainly targeting technical recruiters.


DESIGN CHOICES AND OTHER NOTES
===============================

NAVIGATION
Since I omitted an About page, this website only has the homepage and three project
pages. Therefore I didn't feel that a traditional navigation section was necessary. 
Each project page has a single link going back to the homepage, and the homepage
links to each of the project pages. 

RESUME
The resume link in the version you are receiving does not work. I left it out of the
directory since it seemed tangential to the assignment. On my actual website 
(victoriado.com) the link will open up a PDF. 

RESPONSIVENESS
Unfortunately, I did not have time to make the website fully responsive. However, the
main background graphic will scale to the window size. The homepage is almost responsive, 
but the project pages are not.

FONT
Since my font of choice is stored on Google's servers, it is ideal to view this webpage
while connected to the internet.
