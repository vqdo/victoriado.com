				<p>As a rising sophomore, I was excited to learn that Women in Computing at UCSD was redesigning their website. I contacted WIC's webmaster, and she was kind enough to let me pitch some ideas. In the years since working on this project, WIC has made a huge impact on the UCSD campus and has done a fantastic job furthering their mission.</p>

				<p>The featured design is definitely the most feminine one I did. The light color scheme, the script writing, and the ample amount of white space invokes a general "scrapbooking" vibe. Later iterations of the design held onto the feminine component, but better served the purpose of the organization.</p>
